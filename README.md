## Repository Purpose

This fork aims to explore, customize, and further enhance the capabilities of **ChatDev**—a virtual software company powered by intelligent agents. Through these agents, I'm aiming to streamline the software development process, experimenting with new workflows, and pushing the boundaries of collective intelligence.

## Features in Focus

- **Virtual Software Development Team**: ChatDev is not just software—it represents an entire company with roles such as CEO, CTO, programmer, reviewer, and more.
  
- **Customization & Extension**: The framework is designed to be both highly customizable and extendable, ensuring that it aligns with varied software development methodologies.

- **Collective Intelligence**: Harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to foster collaboration among agents and drive forward the digital programming revolution.
